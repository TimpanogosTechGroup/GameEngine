# About Us

We are a group of students, currently all at Brigham Young University (BYU), who are working together to make a game. We are developing our own custom GameEngine, assets and story with the goal of creating an innovative product that changes the way games are seen by the community. We hope that through this game we capture the imagination of players and the scientific community alike. We hope to learn as we develop this product and consistently work to make it better. We are extremely interested in the possibilities of merging more intelligent neural networks and machine learning techniques to create a dynamic world with constantly changing states while driving forward a central plot tailored for each individual player.
